Overview of Cloud DNS

Cloud DNS is a managed Domain Name System (DNS) service that runs on Google's infrastructure, providing low latency and high availability. It's designed to make applications and services accessible globally in a cost-effective manner.

# Key Features of Cloud DNS

# Global Accessibility:

Provides a public DNS service accessible worldwide via the famous IP address 8.8.8.8.
Helps translate internet hostnames to IP addresses.

# Managed Service:

Runs on the same infrastructure as Google's public DNS, ensuring reliability and performance.
Low latency and high availability.

# Redundant and Scalable:

DNS information is served from redundant locations around the world.
Capable of managing millions of DNS zones and records.

# Programmable:

Manage DNS zones and records via Cloud Console, command-line interface, or API.
Allows automation and integration with other cloud services.

# Overview of Cloud CDN
Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) leverages Google's global edge cache infrastructure to store and deliver content closer to end users, enhancing content delivery speed and reducing server load.

# Key Features of Cloud CDN

# Edge Caching:

Uses caching servers around the world to store content close to end users.
Reduces network latency and improves user experience.
Reduced Server Load:

Decreases the load on the origin servers by caching content at the edges of the network.
Improves scalability and efficiency.

# Cost Efficiency:

Can lead to cost savings by reducing the bandwidth usage from the origin servers.
Easy Integration:

Integrates seamlessly with HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
Can be enabled with a single checkbox in the setup.

# CDN Interconnect Partner Program:

Supports integration with various other CDNs, allowing continued use of existing CDN services.

# Key Terminology
